FITNESS TRACKER APPLICATION - SUPER SAIYAN DOCUMENTATION
ULTRA-DETAILED PROJECT BREAKDOWN
This document provides an extremely detailed analysis of the Fitness Tracker application, going beyond standard documentation to explain the inner workings, design decisions, and technical implementation details.

CORE ARCHITECTURE DEEP DIVE
MVC Implementation Details
The application implements a Model-View-Controller pattern with these specific characteristics:

Model Layer: Encapsulates database operations and business logic

Direct database interactions via JDBC
Data validation before persistence
Entity relationships management (User-to-Workout one-to-many)
View Layer: Swing-based UI components with custom styling

Component hierarchy with nested panels
Event-driven UI updates
Custom rendering for table cells
Controller Logic: Distributed across UI components

Event listeners handle user interactions
Data flow management between models and views
Background processing for non-blocking operations
FILE-BY-FILE BREAKDOWN
GUI PACKAGE
LoginFrame.java - Authentication Gateway
Detailed Implementation:

Uses CardLayout to toggle between login/register panels
Password handling with JPasswordField for security
Form validation with real-time feedback
Session initialization on successful login
Error handling with user-friendly messages
Technical Decisions:

Card layout chosen over multiple frames for smoother transitions
Direct database authentication rather than service layer for simplicity
Password stored as char[] rather than String for security (prevents String pool memory inspection)
Code Flow:

User enters credentials
handleLogin() validates input format
User.login() checks credentials against database
On success, openMainApplication() initializes main UI
On failure, error message displayed with retry option
MainFrame.java - Application Container
Detailed Implementation:

Uses BorderLayout for optimal component positioning
Manages child panels with lifecycle methods
Maintains user session state
Handles application-wide events
Technical Decisions:

Single frame approach rather than multiple windows
Centralized panel management for consistent UI
Direct panel references for performance over event-based communication

Limits to single result for performance
User Workouts Query:

sql

SELECT * FROM workouts WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY workout_date DESC
Uses index on user_id
