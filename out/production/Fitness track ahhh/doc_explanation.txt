Explanation of Each Class and Their Relationships:
DatabaseConnection:

Attributes:

URL: The URL to connect to the database.

USER: The username for the database connection.

PASSWORD: The password for the database connection.

Methods:

getConnection(): Establishes a connection to the database using the provided credentials.

Role: This class is used to establish and manage the connection to your MySQL database. Other classes can call this to access data in the database.

User (Abstract Class):

Attributes:

id: The user's ID.

name: The user's name.

email: The user's email.

password: The user's password.

Methods:

Getter methods for id, name, email, and password.

Role: This is the base class for all types of users (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Expert). It provides a foundation with common properties for user information.

Beginner (Subclass of User):

Attributes:

level: The user's skill level (e.g., Beginner).

Methods:

getLevel(): Returns the level of the user.

Role: The Beginner class is a specific type of user. It inherits from the User class but adds properties or methods specific to beginners, such as the user's level.

WorkoutTracker:

Attributes:

workoutList: A list of workouts tracked by the user (assuming this contains workout objects).

progress: The user's progress on their workout routine.

date: The date the workout was logged or tracked.

Methods:

startWorkout(): Begins a workout tracking session.

trackProgress(): Updates or tracks the progress of the workout session.

Role: This class tracks the user's workout history and current progress. It can be used to log workout sessions and calculate progress over time.

ProgressTracker:

Attributes:

workoutProgress: The user's progress on their workout routine.

dietProgress: The user's progress on their diet plan (though the DietPlan class isn't present, this could imply diet-related progress).

Methods:

updateProgress(): Updates the overall workout and/or diet progress for the user.

Role: This class tracks both workout and diet progress. It interacts with the WorkoutTracker to update and manage progress.

Relationships:
Inheritance:

Beginner inherits from User, meaning it takes on all the properties and methods of User. The Beginner class adds additional functionality (in this case, the level attribute).

Association:

User is connected to WorkoutTracker through a direct relationship, meaning a user can have workout sessions tracked by the WorkoutTracker.

ProgressTracker monitors and updates the progress of both WorkoutTracker (workout progress) and potentially diet progress (although diet isn't represented here).

One-to-Many Relationships:

A User (e.g., Beginner) may have multiple workout sessions, hence the WorkoutTracker class can manage a list of workouts (workoutList).

ProgressTracker aggregates data from WorkoutTracker (and potentially diet data, if that were included).
